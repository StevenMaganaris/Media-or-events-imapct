	<h1>What helps and impacts me personally</h1>
  <h2>Video games are a big help</h2>
  <p> Video games help me a lot with different things. For example, If I am stressed out or worried about something, sometimes I will just go into my room, turn on my console and game to help keep my mind off of what ever I don't want to think about at that time. Video games also play a big part as I have many great realtionships with friends that I play with every day which really lighten the mood and always give me a good laugh.</p>
<p> While gaming in general does help me, One of the game that I feel like helps me the most is GTA 5. While GTA might have a rep of sometimes being a "violent game" or a innopropiate game, I don't think that it is at all.It actully can be a totally tame game if you play it right. Something that I do in GTA 5 that helps me is missions and races. Doing these missons and races are really fun to me and I am able to just have fun with my freinds without any rules or interuptions.</p>
