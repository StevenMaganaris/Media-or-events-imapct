	<h1>What helps and impacts me personally</h1>
  <h2>Video games are a big help</h2>
  <p> Video games help me a lot with different things. For example, If I am stressed out or worried about something, sometimes I will just go into my room, turn on my console and game to help keep my mind off of what ever I don't want to think about at that time.</p>
